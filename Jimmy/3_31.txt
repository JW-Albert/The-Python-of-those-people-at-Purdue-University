Analysis of Descriptive Statistics for Categorical Data

1. Mean (Average)
    Not applicable because categorical data cannot be added or averaged.
    Example: You cannot calculate the "average breed" of dogs.

2. Median (Middle Value)
    Not applicable because categorical data does not have a meaningful order.
    Example: There is no logical ranking of dog breeds.

3.Mode (Most Frequent Value)
    Applicable because it identifies the most commonly occurring category.

Final Answer
    Mode is the only descriptive statistic that applies to categorical data.
    Mean and median do not work because they require numerical operations.
