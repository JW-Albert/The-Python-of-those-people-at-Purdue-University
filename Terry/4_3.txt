1.Missing return statement

The function calculates x ** 3, but the result is not returned.
Instead, the function implicitly returns None.
When calling cube(2), the output will be:
The cube of 2 is None

2. Function call inside its own definition

The line print('The cube of 2 is', cube(2)) is inside the function body.
This causes infinite recursion, as cube(2) keeps calling itself indefinitely.
The program will crash due to a RecursionError.
